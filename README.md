# SQL Portfolio - Northwind Database Analysis

This repository contains my SQL portfolio project where I analyze the **Northwind database** to answer various business-related questions using **SQL queries**. The project demonstrates my ability to work with a **relational database**, perform **data analysis**, and generate **insights using SQL**.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
📂 Dataset          # Contains the original datasets used for analysis.
📂 Outputs          # Contains the result of SQL queries saved as CSV files.
📄 retailAnalysis.sql   # SQL queries used for data analysis.
```

## 📌 SQL Queries & Questions Answered

The queries in this project aim to answer the following business questions:

1. **What is the total number of orders placed by all customers?**
2. **How many products are available in each category?**
3. **Who are the top customers contributing the most revenue to the business?**
4. **Which products are the most frequently sold?**
5. **What is the frequency of customer orders by location, and how does it vary across regions?**
6. **What is the average shipping time for orders in each region, and how consistent are these shipping times across different cities?**
7. **Which products generate the highest revenue, and how does this compare to their sales volume?**
8. **Which employee is responsible for handling the most orders, and what is their overall performance?**
9. **What is the total revenue generated by each region, and what are the top-performing products in each region?**
10. **How does the total revenue differ between orders with discounts and those without discounts? Does applying discounts lead to an overall increase in revenue?**
11. **What percentage of all orders include a discount, and how does this vary by region?**

Each question corresponds to a CSV file in the **Outputs** folder. The files are named `output1.csv`, `output2.csv`, etc.

## 🔧 Steps to Reproduce

To replicate this project on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Load the Northwind database** into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. **Run the queries** in `retailAnalysis.sql` file to generate the results.
4. The results of the queries will be saved in the **Outputs** folder as CSV files.

## 📊 Insights

For each question, I have conducted an analysis of the data and provided **insights based on the results**. These insights are available in the **Outputs folder**, where the processed data is displayed.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.)
- **MySQL Workbench** (for running queries)
- **CSV** (for storing and sharing the output)
